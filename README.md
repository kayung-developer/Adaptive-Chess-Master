## üöÄ How to Play / Run

1.  **Download:**
    *   Simply download the `index.html` file (or clone this repository).
2.  **Open in Browser:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    *   No server is needed; it runs entirely client-side.
3.  **Play!**
    *   You play as White. Click a piece to select it, then click a valid destination square to move.
    *   Use the "New Game" button to start over.
    *   Explore the "Master Controls" panel on the right to adjust AI settings, toggle the coach, and view your stats.

All game data, including history and achievements, is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. Clearing your browser's site data for this page will erase your progress.

## üéÆ Controls

*   **Mouse:**
    *   Click your (White) pieces to select them. Valid moves will be highlighted.
    *   Click a highlighted valid move square to make the move.
    *   Click the selected piece again to deselect it.
*   **Buttons (Top of Game Area):**
    *   `New Game`: Starts a new chess match.
    *   `Toggle Coach`: Turns the real-time move suggestion coach ON or OFF.
    *   `üé§ (Voice Command)`: Activates listening for voice commands.
*   **Master Controls Panel (Right Side):**
    *   **AI Settings:**
        *   `AI Personality`: Choose the AI's play style.
        *   `AI Difficulty (Depth)`: Set how many moves ahead the AI thinks.
        *   `Adaptation Speed`: Adjust how quickly the "Adaptive" AI changes.
    *   **Visualizations (Conceptual):** Toggles for features not yet visually implemented.
    *   **Real-Time Coach:** Displays coach advice and voice command status.
    *   **Achievements:** Shows earned badges and game statistics.
    *   **Match History:** Lists recent games with replay options and a "Clear History" button.
*   **Post-Game Replay Controls (Appear after selecting replay):**

    *   `Exit Replay`: Return to the main game interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Database:** `sql.js` (SQLite compiled to WebAssembly) for in-browser database storage.
*   **Persistence:** Browser `localStorage` is used to store the `sql.js` database file.
*   **Chess Logic:** Custom-implemented chess rules, move generation, and game state management. The move generation (`getLegalMovesForPiece`) is currently a simplified pseudo-legal move generator and does not implement all subtleties of a full chess engine.
*   **AI:** Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.
*   **Speech:** Browser's Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition` for input, `SpeechSynthesis` for output).

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

*   **Full Chess Engine Integration:** Replace custom chess logic with a more robust engine like Stockfish.js for perfect move validation and stronger AI.
*   **Implement Visualizations:** Actually draw the "Board Control Heatmap" and "AI Move Prediction" on the board.
*   **Puzzle Mode:** Add a section for chess puzzles.
*   **More Complex AI Adaptation:** Develop more sophisticated learning algorithms for the AI based on player history.
*   **Improved Opening Book:** Give the AI a more extensive repertoire of opening moves.
*   **Full Draw Condition Checks:** Implement threefold repetition and other less common draw rules.
*   **Enhanced Post-Game Analysis:** Provide more detailed feedback, identify blunders, good moves, etc.
*   **User Theming:** Allow users to choose different board and piece styles.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues / Limitations

*   **Simplified Chess Logic:** The current move generation (`getLegalMovesForPiece`) is not a full legal move generator. It may miss some complex legal moves or allow some illegal ones in edge cases (especially around checks, pins, and king safety). This is the most significant limitation for serious chess play.
*   **Voice Commands:** Are experimental and highly dependent on browser support and microphone quality. Accuracy may vary.
*   **Performance:** AI at higher difficulty depths (especially depth 4+) can be slow as calculations are done in the browser.
*   **Conceptual Features:** Some UI elements (like visualization toggles) are placeholders for features not yet fully implemented visually.
*   **No Threefold Repetition:** This draw condition is not currently checked.
